3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for

Solution- 1. Logical AND (and): This operator returns True if both operands are True, and False otherwise. 
                                It evaluates to False as soon as any operand is False.

         2. Logical OR (or): This operator returns True if at least one of the operands is True, and False if both operands are False.
                             It evaluates to True as soon as any operand is True.

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?

Solution- 1. range(10): This expression generates a sequence of numbers starting from 0 and ending at 9 (exclusive), incrementing by 1 by default. It is equivalent to range(0, 10, 1)


          2. range(0, 10): This expression generates a sequence of numbers starting from 0 and ending at 9 (exclusive), incrementing by 1. The starting value of 0 is explicitly specified. 
          3. range(0, 10, 1): This expression generates a sequence of numbers starting from 0 and ending at 9 (exclusive), incrementing by 1. Both the starting value and the increment are explicitly specified.
          
          The difference lies in the way the arguments are provided to the range() function, with the second and third forms allowing explicit specification of the starting value and the increment.
